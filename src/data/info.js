    'Grey Scale' : `Grayscale is a range of monochromatic shades from black to white. Therefore, a grayscale image contains only shades of gray and no color.\n\nIn digital images, grayscale means that the value of each pixel represents only the intensity information of the light. Such images typically display only the darkest black to the brightest white.\n\nIn other words, the image contains only black, white, and gray colors, in which gray has multiple levels.`,
    'Invert' : `Invert is a color effect that inverts the colors of an image. Inverting the colors of an image means that the colors of the image are reversed. For example, if the image is black and white, the image is inverted to white and black.`,
    'Mask': `Mask is a color effect that applies a mask to an image.\n\nA mask is a black and white image that is used to mask the image. The mask is applied to the image by using the color of the mask to determine the color of the image.`,
    'Region of Interest (Blue)': `A region of interest (often abbreviated ROI), are samples within a data set identified for a particular purpose.\n\nThe concept of a ROI is commonly used in many application areas. For example, in medical imaging, the boundaries of a tumor may be defined on an image or in a volume, for the purpose of measuring its size.\n\nThe endocardial border may be defined on an image, perhaps during different phases of the cardiac cycle, for example, end-systole and end-diastole, for the purpose of assessing cardiac function. In geographical information systems (GIS), a ROI can be taken literally as a polygonal selection from a 2D map.\n\nIn computer vision and optical character recognition, the ROI defines the borders of an object under consideration. In many applications, symbolic (textual) labels are added to a ROI, to describe its content in a compact manner. Within a ROI may lie individual points of interest (POIs).`,

    'Blur': `Blurs the image by averaging the neighboring pixels.\n\nIn Digital image processing, blurring is used to make an image smooth in which edges are not observed. Suppose, we have an image in which there are 508*340=172,720 pixels.\n\nIf we want to blur this image, then all the 172,720-pixel values will be changed by using the blurring technique and convolution as we know that in an image, there are 8 pixels around it. When these pixels are combined as 8+1=9, a 3x3 matrix is formed. In our image, there are 172,720 pixels, so there will be 172,720 matrices of 3x3 orders.\n\nBy applying convolution in all 172,720 matrices with a common matrix called the kernel.\n\nThe kernel is a special matrix, it changes the pixels using convolution to make an image blur. A low pass filter is used for blurring as it allows the low frequency to allow and stop the high frequency. The term frequency means to change the value of the pixel.`,
    'Gaussian Blur' : `In image processing, a Gaussian blur (also known as Gaussian smoothing) is the result of blurring an image by a Gaussian function (named after mathematician and scientist Carl Friedrich Gauss).\n\nIt is a widely used effect in graphics software, typically to reduce image noise and reduce detail. The visual effect of this blurring technique is a smooth blur resembling that of viewing the image through a translucent screen, distinctly different from the bokeh effect produced by an out-of-focus lens or the shadow of an object under usual illumination.`,
    'Black Hat': `Enhance dark objects of interest in a bright background.`,
    'Top Hat': `This function is the white top hat (also called top hat). In mathematical morphology and digital image processing, top-hat transform is an operation that extracts small elements and details from given images. The white top-hat transform is defined as the difference between the input image and its opening by some structuring element. Top-hat transforms are used for various image processing tasks, such as feature extraction, background equalization, image enhancement, and others.`,
    'Sobel' :  `The Sobel method, or Sobel filter, is a gradient-based method that looks for strong changes in the first derivative of an image.\n\nThe Sobel edge detector uses a pair of 3 × 3 convolution masks, one estimating the gradient in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. This edge detector maps well to CUDA, as each thread can apply the 3 × 3 convolution masks to its pixel and adjoining pixels in the image.`,

    'Canny Edge': `The Canny edge detector is a multi-stage edge detector. It is most commonly used to find edges in images.\n\nThe Canny algorithm works by applying a series of gradient operators, each of which reduces the amount of noise in the image. The result of each step is stored in a temporary image. The final result is the combination of the intermediate images.\n\nThe first stage applies a filter that finds the intensity of the edges in the image. This filter is a combination of a Gaussian filter and a derivative filter. The result of this stage is an image containing the gradient magnitude.\n\nThe second stage applies a non-maximum suppression operator, which uses the gradient direction to eliminate spurious edges. This stage outputs an image containing the edges, but with the non-maximum suppression part removed.\n\nThe third stage finds the actual edges by thresholding the gradient magnitude image. This stage outputs a binary image with zero representing non-edges and non-zero representing edges.`,
